name: Build, Test & Publish Snapid

# Triggers for this workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Run when code is pushed to main
    tags:
      - "v*" # Run when a version tag is pushed (like v1.0.0)

jobs:
  build-test-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # GitHub will run this workflow on a Linux runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        # Explanation: This step downloads your repo code to the runner so subsequent steps can access it

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20 # Specify Node version
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
        # Explanation: Installs Node.js 20 on the runner and sets npm registry to default

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        # Explanation: Installs all dependencies from package-lock.json
        # npm ci is faster and ensures exact versions

      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
        # Explanation: Runs all unit, collision, and performance tests to ensure code is working

      # Step 5: Build the package
      - name: Build package
        run: npm run build
        # Explanation: Compiles TypeScript code into JS + declaration files in the dist/ folder

      # Step 6: Publish to npm
      - name: Publish package
        run: npm publish --access public
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
        # Explanation: Publishes package to npm using a secure token stored in GitHub Secrets
        # --access public ensures the package is publicly available
